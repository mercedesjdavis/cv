    <p><em>#1 Egirl Streamer On <strong><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sadiebunny">Twitch</a></strong></em></p>
    <p>Sadie started playing games at the tender age of two. Her family called her the next World Pac Man Champion. At the age of 5, she recieved her first console. The Nintendo 64. It changed her life forever. She was exposed to games such as Mario
        Kart, The Legend Of Zelda and Donkey Kong.The Young girl showed much promise. Unforunately she had to start school soon. And it took up all her time to where she wasn't able to play games anymore. It wasn't until her 16th birthday where she would
        discover her love of gaming again.</p></td>
